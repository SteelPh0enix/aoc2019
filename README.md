# Advent of Code 2019

i don't have anything better to do this month tbh, guess i can have some fun.
everything there will be created using C++ (preferably C++14), on my Ubuntu 18.04 WSL (GCC 7.4.0).
Makefiles included, in case you'd ever want to compile and run this.

also i will *try* to make unit tests.
